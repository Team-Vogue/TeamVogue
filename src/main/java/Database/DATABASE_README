-There are 2 static classes in Database Functions, DBAccounts and DBImages
    -DBAccounts is all the needed functions for manipulating account information in db
    -DBImages is all the needed functions for manipulating Images in the db

-DBAccounts examples...

       To add a user:

       //this connects to database
       DatabaseFunctions.Connect();

       //this Instantiates user entity
       User user = new User(username: "Test15", password: "Test1234");

       //this adds user to the database and returns the User_ID
       DatabaseFunctions.CurrentUserID = DatabaseFunctions.DBAccounts.CreateUser(user);

       To Get a User:
       //gets user from user ID
       User user = DatabaseFunctions.DBAccounts.SelectUser(User_ID);

       or

       //gets User ID from User
       User user = new User("Test15", "Test1234");
       //if -1 then the user does not exist
       int User_ID = DatabaseFunctions.DBAccounts.SelectUserID(user);

To work with images and their database functions they work the same way but replace DBAccounts with DBImages and
use the Image entity and not User.

SelectImages(User_ID) and SelectImages() both return lists of image entities. use this to iterate over images and
get a group of images.

Image Entity requires a user_id and image string, just place "" there and set it to set a buffered image,
It will auto convert
